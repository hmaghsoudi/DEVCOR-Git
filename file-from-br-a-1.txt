Branch main-br-a, a branch from the main branch.

hanya@hanya-virtual-machine:~/DEVCOR/DEVCOR-Git$ git branch -avv
  main                b2b3152 [origin/main] Initial commit
* main-br-a           b2b3152 Initial commit
  main-br-b           b2b3152 Initial commit
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/main
  remotes/origin/main b2b3152 Initial commit

Before editing: Only README file existed.

Now I'm adding this text file, from-br-a.txt

Next step will be to add to staging area, then commit.


Will be adding 3 commits to branch main-br-a and then do a merge on main.
Want to see if I see all 3 commits or only the last one.

Then I will try again with rebase.
This is commit 17th on main-br-a.

Merge shows all commits in the history, but when you switch to them, they don't have everything main (receiver) has. They only have what the source has.
I'm thinking maybe if I do rebase, I can switch back on the receiver with the whole directory there.

Also editing this file on main-br-a, trying to see even without commit I can see it on main.
Checking out to main without commiting here.
