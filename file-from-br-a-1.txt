Branch main-br-a, a branch from the main branch.

hanya@hanya-virtual-machine:~/DEVCOR/DEVCOR-Git$ git branch -avv
  main                b2b3152 [origin/main] Initial commit
* main-br-a           b2b3152 Initial commit
  main-br-b           b2b3152 Initial commit
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/main
  remotes/origin/main b2b3152 Initial commit

Before editing: Only README file existed.

Now I'm adding this text file, from-br-a.txt

Next step will be to add to staging area, then commit.


Will be adding 3 commits to branch main-br-a and then do a merge on main.
Want to see if I see all 3 commits or only the last one.

Then I will try again with rebase.
This is commit 17th on main-br-a.
