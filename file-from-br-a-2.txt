This will be the 19th commit. Creating this new file file-from-br-a-2.txt.
After this, I will switch back to main and merge.
Hoping for losing history of 17th and 18th commits.


So the history did show it.
But when you switch to it on main, you only see the files in main-br-a and not main's files.
Now commiting 21st commit on main-br-a, and then will do a rebase.
Hoping when I go back to main and switch back to a commit, I have everything there.
